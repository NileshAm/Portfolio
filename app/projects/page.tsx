        RoboGames is a prestigious inter-university robotics competition that
        challenges participants to design, engineer, and battle autonomous or
        remotely controlled robots in a series of tactical combat rounds.
        Representing our university as Team LYNX, we participated with a
        custom-built battle robot engineered for durability, speed, and
        precision in a high-impact arena setting.
