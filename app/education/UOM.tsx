              The University of Moratuwa—familiarly known as Mora—is Sri
              Lanka&apos;s leading public technological university, situated in
              Katubedda, Moratuwa, overlooking Bolgoda Lake . With roots dating
              back to the Government Technical College (established in 1893), it
              later became the Ceylon Technical College and Katubedda Campus of
              the University of Ceylon in 1972, before gaining full university
              status in 1978.Today, the university serves more than 11,000
              students (approximately 9,000 undergraduates and 2,500

            ThermoBand is a wearable real time temperature monitoring device
            developed as part of a team project. I led the project, designing
            the 3D-printed enclosure, selecting all necessary components, and
            writing the complete microcontroller code. The ThermoBand captures
            temperature data and presents it in real time, highlighting both
            engineering integration and embedded system development.
